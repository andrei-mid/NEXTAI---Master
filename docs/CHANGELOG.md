# CHANGELOG: what changed, for the other Claude Code instances

**Read this at the start of every session** (newest first). Every change that affects other folders, contracts, conventions or how to work gets an entry here: what changed, why, and what you must do differently. Keep entries short and link the files.

## 2026-10-28: Local-first data access (role 2) · DECIDED

**What:** external data is downloaded onto our server first. Agents only read the local copy (the "mirror") and never call external APIs. Full guide: [docs/LOCAL_DATA.md](LOCAL_DATA.md).

- `verifirm/adapters/base.py`: the TTL cache and "last-known-good" are replaced by the mirror (`mirror/<adapter>/<key>` in the ObjectStore). New: `AdapterDeps.network`, `BaseAdapter.sync(cui) -> SyncReport`, `from_mirror()`, `store_in_mirror()`, `FetchResult.from_mirror` (was `from_cache`).
- `apps/wiring.py`: `infra.adapters` = read-only (agents). `infra.sync_adapters` = may download (sync code only).
- `apps/worker/sync.py` (new): `sync_company(cui)`. The orchestrator calls it once per application/recheck (step 1b) before any agent runs.
- `apps/worker/jobs/sync_portfolio.py` (new, daily in `scheduler.py`).
- Settings renamed: `CACHE_TTL_S` → `MIRROR_MAX_AGE_S`, `CACHE_TTL_OVERRIDES_S` → `MIRROR_MAX_AGE_OVERRIDES_S`, adapter attr `cache_ttl_s` → `mirror_max_age_s`. New: `SYNC_TIMEOUT_S`, `SYNC_ON_APPLICATION`.

**What you must do:**
- **Adapter authors (roles 1, 3, 4, 5):** implement READ methods on `fetch()` + `sync(cui)` with the same cache keys. Bulk sources use `ingest_*` jobs instead. See the checklist in LOCAL_DATA.md and copy `anaf_bilant.py`.
- **Agent authors (roles 3, 4):** use only `ctx.adapter(...)` READ methods. "Not in the local mirror yet" is a `SourceUnavailable`, so report it as unavailable, never as clean. Copy `agents/financials/`.
- **Role 1:** the mirror index table (`persistence/models/source_cache.py`) and bulk tables are where this goes long-term.

## 2026-10-28: Financials agent implemented (role 3 work, done by role 2)

- `verifirm/adapters/anaf_bilant.py`: label-based mapping, `sync()`, `get_year`, `get_history` → `BilantHistory(years, failed)`.
- `verifirm/agents/financials/`: rules (pure, thresholds in `config.yaml`), agent, tests. Interpretations of the brief are recorded in DECISIONS.md.
- `fixtures/tools/build_fixtures.py` now **runs the real financials agent** to produce the financials signals in `api/signals.json`. Other agents should follow: once yours works, replace its hand-written fixture signals with a call to your agent (see `financials_signals()` there).

## 2026-10-28: Scoring engine implemented (role 2)

- `verifirm/scoring/` engine, bands and coverage are implemented and tested. `green_requires_all_ok: true` in `weights.yaml`: **any** source outage means at most YELLOW (demo step 7).
- Scores in the demo fixtures equal the real engine's output (`verifirm/scoring/tests/test_engine.py`).

## 2026-10-28: Scaffold (role 2)

- Initial structure, contracts, stubs, fixtures, docs. Start with [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).
